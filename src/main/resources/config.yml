# Command Override System
# This system allows FoxHomes to take over commands from other plugins.
# For example, if you have Essentials on your server and a player types /home,
# you can use this feature to make FoxHomes' /home command run instead of Essentials'.
# This is very useful for a seamless transition from another homes plugin.
command-override:
  # Use this setting to enable or disable this feature entirely.
  # true = Enabled, false = Disabled.
  enabled: true
